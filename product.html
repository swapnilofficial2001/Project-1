                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Level differences are often bridged with inclined conveyors, for instance in the plastic injection
                    moulding machines sector. Both modular belt conveyors and conveyors with timing belts, but also belt
                    conveyors, are available for this. The lengths of the individual segments of the conveyor or the
                    distances between the cleats can be adapted to the customer’s needs.</p>

                <h4>Timing Belt conveyor</h4>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Timing Belt Conveyor are mostly used for heavier workpiece weights or stricter requirements on
                    precision. In addition, they are frequently used in multi-track conveyors that place strict
                    requirements on the synchronicity of the conveyor strands. In contrast to belt conveyors,
                    workpiece-specific attachments can be added very easily. A common use is for supplying workpiece
                    carriers to robot cells or gantry loaders.</p>

                <h4>Roller Conveyors</h4>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Besides belt conveyors, roller conveyors are standard conveyor technology. They are used frequently,
                    especially for plastic containers or packages with heavy weights. As with all our standard modules,
                    the support is based on item-profile. Therefore, it is easy to incorporate these modules into your
                    production environment. Besides standard roller conveyors, curved roller conveyor are available.
                    Furthermore, the systems can be designed as driven roller conveyor or gravity roller conveyor.</p>

                <h4>MODULAR BELT CONVEYOR</h4>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Modular belt conveyor are a middle ground between belt conveyors and chain conveyors. A modular belt
                    consists of individual plastic modules usually linked together with joint rods. This modular belt is
                    driven by chain spockets; the base frame of the conveyor is constructed on standard profile
                    supports. The modular belt makes it possible to accept hot workpieces or workpieces with sharp
                    edges. Furthermore, large conveyor widths can be implemented without high pre-tensioning of the
                    belts. However, in contrast to chain conveyors, this design is less maintenance-intensive and is a
                    technically simpler solution. These systems are frequently used as cooling lines, since the chain
                    modules can be designed to be permeable to air.</p>

                <h4>Vibratory bowl feeder</h4>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Vibratory bowl feeders are a very common type of parts feeder, and they are a critical part of an
                    automated assembly system. Vibratory bowl feeders move parts around a bowl and into channels in a
                    way that ensures they are perfectly aligned for how the automation system needs them. Vibratory bowl
                    feeders make sure parts are continually being presented to the automation system, so that it can
                    perform as designed and maintain a high production rate. Vibratory bowl feeders also reduce labor,
                    because they require very little human interation. We can develop vibratory bowl feeders from 6″ to
                    36″ in diameter. For optimum efficiency, we design and fabricate our bowl feeders simultaneously.
                    Each bowl is custom built to meet the customer's exact specifications, regarding part configuration,
                    feed rate and orientation. To ensure the precise handling of almost any size and type of part,
                    whether small or large, delicate or heavy duty, every SPM bowl feeder is designed and hand-crafted
                    in-house using 11-gauge stainless steel. Type 304 stainless steel is standard, while Type 316
                    stainless steel is used in medical applications.
