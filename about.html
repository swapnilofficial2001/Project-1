        <p>Setting The Standard In Automation From design to final assembly, all the work is done in-house. We do all
            the engineering, both mechanical and electrical. Our engineering staff has a combined 8 years of experience

            The machining is also done in house, with parts being sent out only for black oxiding and heat treating. We
            build the bases, heads, presses, feeder bowls and index tables. ANALYTIC SOLUTIONS Techno Automation
            manufactures all vibratory drive units for their feeder bowls and maintains a large variety of feeder bowls
            in stock. This means single source reliability and quality. The automation equipment is assembled and tested
            in our facility using top-of-the-line components. When an automated machine leaves ANALYTIC SOLUTIONS, our
            work still isn't done. Our service includes setting up the machine in the customer's plant, doing a
            demonstration run under production conditions, and training your personnel to operate and maintain the
            machine. Production and inspection documentation is an important part of the entire process. It not only
            provides a customized reference guide on the automated equipment, but is also a valuable resource for future
            automated systems in a particular work environment.
            Once your new automated equipment is checked and approved for shipment, our role moves into a crucial phase
            of customer service. Prior to final approval, ANALYTIC SOLUTIONS Techno Automation attends to your new
            automated system on-site, ensuring proper setup and detailed training for your equipment operators. For more
            specific information about ANALYTIC SOLUTIONS Techno Automation's procedures, please visit our Buying
